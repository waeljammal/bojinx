Actionscript 3 IOC Framework

Please note this is the same project that was hosted on the Bojinx site but due to a crash the confluence documentation was lost, I am converting and updating an old copy of the documentation for github.

Pluin Notes
=========================

* Command Plugin is not yet ready for usage, I am re-writing the existing command plugin to provide command mapping features.
* Command Plugin tests will fail but all other tests should pass.
* Refactoring tests with better naming conventions (ie. command_execute_returns_success) instead of using description as it is now.
